# ArXiv-Daily-Report
A program that pulls and emails myself ArXiv research papers for the last day the database was updated (two days prior) with specific search criteria to keep an eye on papers you are interested in (specific author, category, or term in title). I use this with automation setup on my machine to automatically run this script daily at 5PM EST.
